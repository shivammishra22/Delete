The events crossing the threshold as per defined parameter were considered as DECs. 
The DECs were assessed for labelling as per RSI. If the DEC is labeled as per RSI, frequency trend 
was evaluated. 
If DEC is labeled/covered under medical concept based on the information available in innovator/ 
comparatorâ€™s RSI and unlabeled as per MAH RSI, recommendation for label update is proposed. 
If the DEC is unlabeled as per innovator/ comparator and MAH RSI, the DEC was taken up further 
for the clinical assessment. The clinical evaluation included the assessment of the causal 
association between the drug and event and characterization of the qualified signal based on the 
cumulative cases of the event in company safety database. 
The identified signals were further categorized as validated, non-validated signals and events under 
monitoring signal bases on evidence of strength. Signals with insufficient or inconclusive 
information and signals which can be explained on the basis of presence of confounding factors 
such as presence of multiple suspect drugs or concomitant medications or significant medical 
history were categorized as Non-validated signals. The signals with sufficient evidences 
demonstrating the existence of a new potentially causal association or a new aspect of a known 
association and therefore justifies further analysis of the signal were categorized as validated 
signals. Signals with equivocal information which cannot be categorized neither non-validated nor 
has sufficient evidence to be considered as validated, these were categorized as events under 
monitoring signals and kept for further monitoring.
