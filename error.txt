6 DATA IN SUMMARY TABULATIONS 
6.1 Reference Information 
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) versions from 24.1 to 27.1, is valid 
in the reporting period of this PSUR and was used for coding adverse events. The summary 
tabulations are sorted alphabetically by primary System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term 
(PT) level. 
6.2 Cumulative Summary Tabulations of Serious Adverse Events from Clinical Trials 
No information was available as no clinical trials have been conducted by the MAH since obtaining 
MA for Levetiracetam. 
6.3 Cumulative and interval summary tabulations from Post-Marketing Data Sources 
The Safety Database was searched for all individual case safety reports (ICSRs) (also called cases) 
meeting the criteria mentioned below.  
Serious and non-serious Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) from spontaneous ICSRs, including 
reports from healthcare professionals, consumers, scientific literature and regulatory authorities. 
Note: As described in ICH Guideline E2D, spontaneously reported AEs usually imply at least a 
suspicion of causality by the reporter and should be considered to be adverse reactions for 
regulatory reporting purposes. 
• Serious adverse reactions from non-interventional studies and from any other non-interventional 
solicited sources.
• From initial MA worldwide by the MAH to the data lock point (DLP) of this report (= 
cumulative data set)
